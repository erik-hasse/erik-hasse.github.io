<p>
To determine that the applicant exhibits satisfactory knowledge, risk management, and skills associated with spins, flight situations where unintentional spins may occur and procedures for recovery from unintentional spins.

<div id="VII. Slow Flight and Stalls-D. Spin Awareness-Knowledge"><h3 id="Knowledge" class="header"><a href="#VII. Slow Flight and Stalls-D. Spin Awareness-Knowledge">Knowledge</a></h3></div>

<ol>
<li>
Aerodynamics associated with spins in various airplane configurations, to include the relationship between angle of attack, airspeed, load factor, power setting, airplane weight and center of gravity, airplane attitude, and yaw effects.

<li>
What causes a spin and how to identify the entry, incipient, and developed phases of a spin.

<ul>
<li>
Spins are caused by slipping or skidding stalls

<li>
Common causes:

<ul>
<li>
Engine failure on takeoff

<li>
Base to final turn

<li>
Engine failure on approach

<li>
Go-around with nose-up trim

<li>
Go-around with improper flap retraction

</ul>
</ul>
<li>
Spin recovery procedure.

<div id="VII. Slow Flight and Stalls-D. Spin Awareness-Risk Management"><h3 id="Risk Management" class="header"><a href="#VII. Slow Flight and Stalls-D. Spin Awareness-Risk Management">Risk Management</a></h3></div>

<ol>
<li>
Factors and situations that could lead to an inadvertent spin and loss of control.

<li>
Range and limitations of stall warning indicators (e.g. airplane buffet, stall horn, etc.).

<li>
Improper spin recovery procedure.

<li>
Effect of environmental elements on airplane performance (e.g., turbulence, microbursts, and high-density altitude).

<li>
Collision hazards, to include aircraft, terrain, obstacles, and wires.

<li>
Distractions, loss of situational awareness, or improper task management.
