<p>
To determine that the applicant exhibits satisfactory knowledge, risk management, and skills associated with maneuvering during slow flight.
</p>

<div id="VII. Slow Flight and Stalls-A. Maneuvering During Slow Flight-Knowledge"><h3 id="Knowledge" class="header"><a href="#VII. Slow Flight and Stalls-A. Maneuvering During Slow Flight-Knowledge">Knowledge</a></h3></div>

<ol>
<li>
Aerodynamics associated with slow flight in various airplane configurations, to include the relationship between angle of attack, airspeed, load factor, power setting, airplane weight and center of gravity, airplane attitude, and yaw effects.

</ol>

<div id="VII. Slow Flight and Stalls-A. Maneuvering During Slow Flight-Risk Management"><h3 id="Risk Management" class="header"><a href="#VII. Slow Flight and Stalls-A. Maneuvering During Slow Flight-Risk Management">Risk Management</a></h3></div>

<ol>
<li>
Inadvertent slow flight and flight with a stall warning, which could lead to loss of control.

<li>
Range and limitations of stall warning indicators (e.g. airplane buffet, stall horn, etc.).

<li>
Failure to maintain coordinated flight.

<li>
Effect of environmental elements on airplane performance (e.g., turbulence, microbursts, and high-density altitude).

<li>
Collision hazards, to include aircraft, terrain, obstacles, and wires.

<li>
Distractions, loss of situational awareness, or improper task management.

</ol>

<div id="VII. Slow Flight and Stalls-A. Maneuvering During Slow Flight-Skills"><h3 id="Skills" class="header"><a href="#VII. Slow Flight and Stalls-A. Maneuvering During Slow Flight-Skills">Skills</a></h3></div>

<ol>
<li>
Clear the area.

<li>
Select an entry altitude that will allow the Task to be completed no lower than 1,500 feet AGL.

<li>
Establish and maintain an airspeed at which any further increase in angle of attack, increase in load factor, or reduction in power, would result in a stall warning (e.g. airplane buffet, stall horn, etc.).

<li>
Accomplish coordinated straight-and-level flight, turns, climbs, and descents with the airplane configuration as specified by the evaluator without a stall warning (e.g. airplane buffet, stall horn, etc.).

<li>
Maintain the specified altitude +-100 feet, specified heading +-10 deg, airspeed +10/-0 knots, and specified angle of bank +-10 deg.
