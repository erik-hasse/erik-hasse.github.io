Go-around and rejected landing

<li>
Land and hold short operations (LAHSO)

</ol>
<li>
Collision hazards, to include aircraft, terrain, obstacles, wires, vehicles, vessels, persons, and wildlife.

<li>
Low altitude maneuvering including stall, spin, or CFIT.

<ol>
<li>
Complete the appropriate checklist.

<li>
Make radio calls as appropriate.

<li>
Ensure the airplane is aligned with the correct/assigned runway or landing surface.

<li>
Scan the runway or landing surface and the adjoining area for traffic or obstructions.

<li>
Select and aim for a suitable touchdown point considering the wind, landing surface, and obstructions.

<li>
Establish the recommended approach and landing configuration and airspeed, and adjust pitch attitude and power as required to maintain a stabilized approach.

<li>
Maintain manufacturer's published approach airspeed or in its absence not more than 1.3V_SO, +10/-5 knots with gust factor applied.

<li>
Maintain directional control and appropriate crosswind correction throughout the approach and landing.

<li>
Make smooth, timely, and correct control inputs during round out and touchdown, and, for tricycle gear airplanes, keep the nosewheel off the suface until loss of elevator effectiveness

<li>
Touch down at a proper pitch attitude with minimum sink rate, no side drift, and with the airplane's longitudinal axis aligned with the center of the runway.

<li>
Maintain elevator as recommended by manufacturer during rollout and exit the "soft" area at a speed that would preclude sinking into the surface.

<li>
Execute a timely go-around if the approach cannot be made within the tolerances specified above or for any other condition that may result in an unsafe approach or landing.

<li>
Maintain proper position of the flight controls and sufficient speed to taxi while on the soft surface.
