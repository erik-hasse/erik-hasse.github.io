<ol>
<li>
Selection of runway or approach path and touchdown area based on pilot capability, airplane performance and limitations, available distance, and wind.

<li>
Effects of:

<ol>
<li>
Crosswind

<li>
Windshear

<li>
Tailwind

<li>
Wake turbulence

<li>
Runway surface/condition

</ol>
<li>
Planning for:

<ol>
<li>
Go-around and rejected landing

<li>
Land and hold short operations (LAHSO)

</ol>
<li>
Collision hazards, to include aircraft, terrain, obstacles, wires, vehicles, vessels, persons, and wildlife.

<li>
Low altitude maneuvering including stall, spin, or CFIT.

<li>
Distractions, loss of situational awareness, or improper task management.

<li>
Forward slip operations, including fuel flowage, tail talls with flaps, and lack of airspeed control.

<li>
Surface contact with the airplane's longitudinal axis misaligned.

<li>
Unstable approach.

</ol>

<ol>
<li>
Complete the appropriate checklist.

<li>
Make radio calls as appropriate.

<li>
Plan and follow a flightpath to the selected landing are considering altitude, wind, terrain, and obstructions.

<li>
Select the most suitable touchdown point based on wind, landing surface, obstructions, and airplane limitations.

<li>
Position the airplane on downwind leg, parallel to landing runway.

<li>
Configure the airplane correctly.

<li>
As necessary, correlate crosswind with direction of forward slip and transition to sideslip before touchdown.

<li>
Touch down at a proper pitch attitude, within 400 feet beyond or on the specified point, with no side drift, and with the airplane's longitudinal axis aligned with and over the runway center/landing path.

<li>
Maintain a ground track aligned with the runway center/landing path.
