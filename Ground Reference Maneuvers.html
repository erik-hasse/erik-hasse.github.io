<ol>
<li>
Clear the area.

<li>
Select a suitable ground reference area, line, or point as appropriate.

<li>
Plan the maneuver:

<ol>
<li>
Rectangular course: enter a left or right pattern, 600 to 1,000 feet above ground level (AGL) at an appropriate distance from the selected reference area, 45 deg to the downwind leg.

<li>
S-turns: enter perpendicular to the selected reference line, 600 to 1,000 feet AGL at an appropriate distance from the selected reference area.

<li>
Turns around a point: enter at an appropriate distance from the reference point, 600 to 1,000 feet AGL at an appropriate distance from the selected reference area.

</ol>
<li>
Apply adequate wind-drift correction during straight and turning flight to maintain a constant ground track around a rectangular reference area, or to maintain a constant radius turn on each side of a selected reference line or point.

<li>
If performing S-turns, referse the turn directly over the selected reference line; if performing turns around a point, complete turns in either direction, as specified by the evaluator.

<li>
Divide attention between airplane control, traffic avoidance and the ground track while maintaining coordinated flight.

<li>
Maintain altitude +-100 feet; maintain airspeed +-10 knots.

</ol>
