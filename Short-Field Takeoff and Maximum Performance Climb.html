<ol>
<li>
Complete the appropriate checklist.

<li>
Make radio calls as appropriate.

<li>
Verify assigned/correct runway.

<li>
Ascertain wind direction with or without visible wind direction indicators.

<li>
Position the flight controls for the existing wind.

<li>
Clear the area; taxi into takeoff position and align the airplane on the runway centerline utilizing maximum available takeoff area.

<li>
Apply brakes while setting engine power to achieve maximum performance.

<li>
Confirm takeoff power prior to brake release and verify proper engine and flight instrument indications prior to rotation.

<li>
Rotate and lift off at the recommended airspeed and accelerate to the recommended obstacle clearance airspeed or V_X, +10/-5 knots.

<li>
Establish a ptch attitude that will maintain the recommended obstacle clearance airspeed or V_X, +10/-5 kots until clearing the obstacle or until the airplane is 50 feet above the surface.

<li>
Establish a pitch attitude for V_Y and accelerate to V_Y +10/-5 knots after clearing the obstacle or at 50 feet AGL if simulating an obstacle.

<li>
Configure the airplane in accordance with manufacturer's guidance after a positive rate of climb has been verified.

<li>
Maintain V_Y +10/-5 knots to a safe maneuvering altitude.

<li>
Maintain directional control and proper wind-drift correction throughout takeoff and climb.

<li>
Comply with noise abatement procedures.
