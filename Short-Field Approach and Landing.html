<ol>
<li>
Complete the appropriate checklist.

<li>
Make radio calls as appropriate.

<li>
Ensure the airplane is aligned with the correct/assigned runway or landing surface.

<li>
Scan the runway or landing surface and the adjoining area for traffic or obstructions.

<li>
Select and aim for a suitable touchdown point considering the wind, landing surface, and obstructions.

<li>
Establish the recommended approach and landing configuration and airspeed, and adjust pitch attitude and power as required to maintain a stabilized approach.

<li>
Maintain manufacturer's published approach airspeed or in its absence not more than 1.3V_SO, +10/-5 knots with gust factor applied.

<li>
Maintain directional control and appropriate crosswind correction throughout the approach and landing.

<li>
Make smooth, timely, and correct control application during round out and touchdown.

<li>
Touch down at a proper pitch attitude, within 200 feet beyond or on the specified point, threshold markings, or runway numbers, with no side drift, minimum float, and with the airplane's longitudinal axis aligned with and over the runway center.

<li>
Use manufacturer's recommended procedures for airplane configuration and braking.

<li>
Execute a timely go-around if the approach cannot be made within the tolerances specified above or for any other condition that may result in an unsafe approach or landing.

<li>
Utilize runway incursion avoidance procedures.
