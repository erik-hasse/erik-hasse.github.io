<p>
To determine that the applicant exhibits satisfactory knowledge, risk management, and skills associated with a go-around/rejected landing with emphasis on factors that contribute to landing conditions that may require a go-around.

<ol>
<li>
A stabilized approach, to include energy management concepts.

<li>
Effects of atmospheric conditions, including wind and density altitude, on a go-around or rejected landing.

<ol>
<li>
Delayed recognition of the need for a go-around/rejected landing.

<li>
Delayed performance of a go-around at low altitude.

<li>
Improper application of power.

<li>
Improper airplane configuration.

<li>
Collision hazards, to include aircraft, terrain, obstacles, wires, vehicles, vessels, persons, and wildlife.

<li>
Low altitude maneuvering including stall, spin, or CFIT.

<li>
Distractions, loss of situational awareness, or improper task management.

<ol>
<li>
Complete the appropriate checklist.

<li>
Make radio calls as appropriate.

<li>
Make a timely decision to discontinue the approach to landing.

<li>
Apply takeoff power immediately and transition to a climb pitch attitude for V_X or V_Y as appropriate, +10/-5 knots.

<li>
Configure the airplane after a positive rate of climb has been verified or in accordance with airplane manufacturer's instructions.

<li>
Maneuver to the side of the runway/landing area when necessary to clear and avoid conflicting traffic.

<li>
Maintain V_Y +10/-5 knots to a safe maneuvering altitude.

<li>
Maintain directional control and proper wind-drift correction throughout the climb.
