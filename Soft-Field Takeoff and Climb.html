<ol>
<li>
Complete the appropriate checklist.

<li>
Make radio calls as appropriate.

<li>
Verify assigned/correct runway.

<li>
Ascertain wind direction with or without visible wind direction indicators.

<li>
Position the flight controls for the existing wind.

<li>
Clear the area, maintain necessary flight control inputs, taxi into takeoff position and align the airplane on the runway centerline without stopping, while advancing the throttle smoothly to takeoff power.

<li>
Confirm takeoff power and proper engine and flight instrument indications prior to rotation.

<li>
Lift off at the lowest possible airspeed and remain in ground effect while accelerating to V_X or V_Y, as appropriate.

<li>
Establish a pitch attitude for V_X or V_Y, as appropriate, and maintain the selected airpseed +10/-5 knots during the climb.

<li>
Configure the airplane after a positive rate of climb has been verified or in accordance with manufacturer's instructions.

<li>
Maintain V_X or V_Y, as appropriate, +10/-5 knots to a safe maneuvering altitude.

<li>
Maintain directional control and proper wind-drift correction throughout takeoff and climb.

<li>
Comply with noise abatement procedures.
